# Prothombot1
A [telegram bot](https://t.me/prothom1bot) that could convert any twitter/X url into wikipedia {{[Cite tweet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Cite_tweet)}} Template to use in Wikipedia.
## Background
[Citer tool on toolforge](https://citer.toolforge.org/) is a perfect example of how ProthomBot exactly works. It was [suggested to include the same facility](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Dalba#Suggestion_to_include_tweeter_template) in citer tool, but twitter/X done very well with their system so it's impossible to get the title parameter for {{Cite tweet}} template.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently i am running that bot locally and most of the time it wouldn't available to respond on time.
